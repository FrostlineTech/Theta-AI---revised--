# Theta AI Architecture

This document provides an overview of the Theta AI system architecture and how the different components work together.

## System Overview

Theta AI is a specialized AI assistant for Frostline Solutions, designed to provide accurate information about cybersecurity, software development, and company-specific knowledge. The system consists of several key components:

1. **Model Core**: The neural network foundation (based on transformer architecture)
2. **Data Processing Pipeline**: For training data preparation and tokenization
3. **Training System**: For model training and fine-tuning
4. **Interfaces**: Command-line and web-based interfaces for user interaction
5. **Retrieval System**: For accessing and retrieving relevant information

## Component Architecture

### Model Core

The model is built on a transformer-based architecture optimized for the RTX 3060 GPU:

- Uses gradient accumulation to fit larger batch sizes in limited VRAM
- Implements flash attention for memory efficiency
- Incorporates retrieval-augmented generation for factual accuracy

### Data Processing Pipeline

Located in `src/data_processing/`:
- Handles preprocessing of training data
- Performs tokenization and data augmentation
- Creates training, validation, and test splits

### Training System

Located in `src/training/`:
- Implements training loops with distributed training support
- Handles checkpointing and model saving
- Provides evaluation metrics and validation

### Interfaces

Two primary interfaces:
1. **Command-line Interface** (`src/interface.py`):
   - Lightweight interface for direct interaction
   - Text-based input and output

2. **Web Interface** (`src/web_interface.py`):
   - Flask-based web application
   - Mobile-responsive design
   - Conversation history and session management

### Retrieval System

- Uses TF-IDF similarity for relevant document retrieval
- Implements vector search for semantic matching
- Provides context to the model for grounded responses

## Data Flow

1. User query is received through one of the interfaces
2. Query is preprocessed and tokenized
3. Retrieval system finds relevant information from knowledge base
4. Model generates response based on retrieved context and trained parameters
5. Response is validated for hallucinations and factual consistency
6. Validated response is presented to the user through the interface

## System Requirements

- **Hardware**: NVIDIA RTX 3060 GPU with 12GB VRAM, AMD Ryzen 5-5500 CPU
- **Software**: CUDA toolkit, Python 3.8+, dependencies in requirements.txt
- **Storage**: Minimum 10GB for code, models, and datasets

## Optimization Strategies

- Quantization for reduced memory footprint
- Caching of frequent queries and responses
- Custom attention mechanisms for improved performance
- Knowledge distillation for smaller deployment models

## Future Architecture Extensions

- Multi-GPU training support
- API service for integration with other systems
- Real-time data integration capabilities
- Reinforcement learning from human feedback
