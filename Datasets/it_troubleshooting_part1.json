    "question": "My computer won't turn on. What should I do?",
    "answer": "When a computer won't turn on, follow this systematic troubleshooting approach: 1) Verify power supply issues first - ensure the power cable is securely connected at both ends, try a different power outlet, and if using a laptop, remove the battery and try running directly from AC power. 2) Check if there are any signs of life - look for power LEDs, listen for fans or drive activity, and observe if the power button responds at all. 3) For desktop systems, check internal connections - ensure the power supply cables to the motherboard (both 24-pin main connector and 4/8-pin CPU power) are properly seated, and verify RAM modules are correctly installed. 4) Reset hardware by disconnecting all non-essential peripherals (external drives, printers, etc.), removing and reseating RAM and expansion cards, then trying to power on with minimal components. 5) Test the power supply with a PSU tester or by swapping with a known working unit if available. 6) Check for physical damage - look for bulging or leaking capacitors on the motherboard, signs of electrical damage, or unusual smells that might indicate component failure. 7) Try a power drain - disconnect the computer from power, remove the battery if applicable, hold the power button for 30 seconds to discharge residual power, then reconnect and try again. 8) If you're getting power but no display, try connecting to an alternate monitor to rule out display issues. For persistent problems, the most common failure points are the power supply, motherboard, or CPU, often requiring professional diagnosis or component replacement."

    "question": "How do I troubleshoot slow internet connection?",
    "answer": "Troubleshooting slow internet requires a methodical approach to identify whether the issue is with your network, equipment, ISP, or specific services. Start with basic diagnostics: 1) Run a speed test at speedtest.net or fast.com to quantify your current connection speed and compare it to your expected service level. Run tests at different times of day to identify patterns. 2) Isolate device-specific issues by testing multiple devices on your network - if only one device is affected, focus troubleshooting there. 3) Try both wired and wireless connections to determine if the issue is Wi-Fi specific. For Wi-Fi problems: check signal strength (should be -67dBm or better), reduce distance to router, eliminate physical obstructions, change router channel to avoid interference (use apps like WiFi Analyzer), and ensure you're using the appropriate band (5GHz for speed, 2.4GHz for range). For router issues: reboot your modem and router (power off for 30 seconds before restarting), check for overheating, verify firmware is updated, and consider factory reset if problems persist. Connection-specific checks include: examining for bandwidth saturation by temporarily disconnecting devices or pausing background downloads/updates, checking for malware that might consume bandwidth, and confirming no one is using your network without permission (check connected devices in router interface). For ISP-related problems: check for reported outages in your area, monitor performance patterns during peak usage hours, and use traceroute tools to identify where traffic slowdowns occur. More advanced steps include adjusting DNS servers (try Google's 8.8.8.8 or Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1), updating network adapter drivers, and checking for QoS settings in your router that might be throttling specific traffic. If problems persist after these steps, contact your ISP with documented speed test results and troubleshooting steps already taken."

    "question": "How do I recover a deleted file?",
    "answer": "File recovery options depend on how recently the deletion occurred, the storage medium type, and the deletion method. For immediate recovery after accidental deletion: 1) Check the Recycle Bin/Trash first - Windows and macOS temporarily store deleted files here unless bypassed with Shift+Delete or emptied. 2) Look for automatic backups - Windows File History, macOS Time Machine, or cloud storage version history (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive) may contain previous versions. 3) For files deleted beyond the recycle bin, use file recovery software promptly before the data is overwritten. For Windows, tools like Recuva, TestDisk, or R-Studio can scan for deleted file signatures. For macOS, consider Disk Drill, PhotoRec, or Data Rescue. For Linux, PhotoRec/TestDisk or Extundelete are effective options. Critical factors affecting recovery success include: minimizing disk writes after deletion (avoid installing recovery software on the affected drive), recovery time (faster action means better chances), storage type (SSDs with TRIM enabled make recovery more difficult than HDDs), and filesystem (journaling filesystems like NTFS or HFS+ generally offer better recovery prospects than FAT32). For cloud-based files, check service-specific recovery options - Google Workspace and Microsoft 365 typically maintain deleted items for 30 days, while Dropbox Plus includes 30-day deletion recovery. For accidentally formatted drives or more serious data loss, professional data recovery services may be necessary, though these can be expensive. To prevent future data loss, implement a comprehensive backup strategy using the 3-2-1 approach: three copies of important data, on two different media types, with one copy stored off-site or in cloud storage."

    "question": "My computer is running very slowly. How can I speed it up?",
    "answer": "Computer slowdown typically stems from hardware limitations, software inefficiencies, or malware issues. Begin with a systematic approach: 1) Identify resource bottlenecks using Task Manager (Windows), Activity Monitor (Mac), or top/htop (Linux). Look for processes consuming high CPU, memory, or disk resources. 2) Address startup bloat by disabling unnecessary startup applications through Task Manager > Startup tab (Windows), System Preferences > Users > Login Items (Mac), or Startup Applications (most Linux distros). 3) Free up storage space - maintain at least 15-20% free space on your system drive, use Disk Cleanup (Windows) or equivalent tools to remove temporary files, and uninstall unused applications. 4) Check for malware using reputable security software with a full system scan. 5) Optimize virtual memory/swap space - on Windows, adjust page file settings for optimal performance based on installed RAM; on Mac/Linux, adjust swap partition size if needed. 6) Defragment traditional hard drives (HDD only, not SSD) using the built-in defragmentation tool. 7) Update device drivers, particularly graphics and storage controllers, from manufacturer websites rather than generic sources. 8) Apply operating system updates to ensure security patches and performance improvements. For browser performance specifically: clear cache and cookies regularly, disable unnecessary extensions, and consider lighter alternatives to Chrome if RAM is limited. Hardware upgrades provide more substantial improvements: adding RAM (particularly if regularly at 80%+ usage), replacing HDDs with SSDs for dramatic read/write speed improvements, or upgrading CPUs if consistently at high utilization. For laptops, check for thermal throttling by cleaning dust from cooling systems and replacing thermal paste if the device is older. If the system remains sluggish after software optimizations, consider reinstalling the operating system as a last resort before hardware upgrades. For systems older than 5-7 years, comprehensive performance issues often indicate it's time to evaluate replacement rather than continued optimization."

    "question": "What should I do if my laptop battery drains too quickly?",
    "answer": "Battery drain issues can typically be addressed through software optimization, usage adjustments, or hardware maintenance. Begin with diagnostic assessment: 1) Generate a battery health report in Windows (powercfg /batteryreport from command prompt), use Battery Information in macOS System Report, or check capacity with tools like upower on Linux to determine if capacity has significantly degraded from design specifications. 2) Identify power-hungry applications using Task Manager (Windows), Activity Monitor (Mac), or top/powertop (Linux) - browser tabs, background applications, and poorly optimized software are common culprits. Next, implement software optimizations: 3) Adjust power plans - use Balanced or Power Saver modes in Windows, and optimize Energy Saver settings on macOS. 4) Reduce display brightness - typically the largest single power consumer. 5) Disable keyboard backlighting when not needed. 6) Turn off unused radios (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi) and disconnect peripherals drawing power via USB. 7) Disable background apps and services - particularly those with high CPU/GPU usage or constant network activity. 8) Update your operating system and drivers to incorporate power management improvements. 9) For Windows, use the powercfg -energy command to generate a detailed power efficiency report. Hardware-based solutions include: 10) Clean cooling systems to prevent thermal throttling, which reduces efficiency. 11) Consider replacing the battery if it's over 2-3 years old or shows significant capacity degradation (below 80% of original). For longer runtime: 12) Use hibernate instead of sleep for extended periods of inactivity. 13) Close resource-intensive applications like video editing software, games, or applications using dedicated graphics when not in use. 14) Employ browser extensions that suspend inactive tabs. 15) For Windows, disable Fast Startup if it's causing drainage issues in shutdown state. 16) Calibrate the battery occasionally by fully discharging and then charging to 100%. If battery life remains problematic after these steps, consider an external power bank for extended mobile use or evaluate if the battery needs replacement - most modern laptop batteries maintain acceptable capacity for 2-3 years or 300-500 charge cycles before significant degradation occurs."
