    "question": "My external hard drive isn't being recognized. How can I fix it?",
    "answer": "Unrecognized external drives require progressive troubleshooting to determine whether the issue is connection-related, logical (filesystem/driver), or physical (hardware failure). Start with connection troubleshooting: 1) Try different USB ports, particularly directly connected ports rather than through hubs which may provide insufficient power. 2) Test alternate cables, as USB cables frequently fail internally while appearing intact externally. 3) Verify adequate power supply—larger drives with separate power adapters may not function properly from bus power alone. Check for basic detection: 4) Open Disk Management (Windows, right-click Start > Disk Management), Disk Utility (macOS), or GParted/Disks (Linux) to see if the drive appears but isn't mounted. 5) Look for the device in Device Manager (Windows) or System Information (macOS) even if it doesn't show in file explorer. 6) Listen and feel for spin-up or activity on HDDs or LED activity on SSDs when connected. For drives detected in system tools but not appearing in file explorer: 7) Check if the drive needs initialization or formatting (appears as \"unallocated\" in Disk Management). Note that initializing will erase all data. 8) Assign a drive letter if missing (Windows Disk Management > right-click the volume > Change Drive Letter and Paths). 9) Try mounting the drive manually in macOS/Linux (mount command) or Windows (mountvol command). For filesystem issues: 10) Run CHKDSK /f /r X: (Windows, where X: is the drive letter) or First Aid (macOS Disk Utility) to check and repair filesystem errors. 11) Try data recovery software like Recuva, TestDisk, or R-Studio if the filesystem is corrupted but the drive hardware is functional. For driver-related issues: 12) Uninstall USB controllers from Device Manager and reboot to force driver reinstallation. 13) Update chipset and USB drivers from the motherboard manufacturer. For potential physical failures: 14) Note unusual sounds like clicking, grinding, or repetitive spin-up attempts which indicate mechanical failure. 15) Check for overheating which may trigger thermal protection shutdown. For encrypted drives: 16) Ensure necessary encryption software is installed and functioning (BitLocker, FileVault, VeraCrypt, etc.). If these steps fail to resolve the issue: 17) Try the drive in another computer to isolate PC-specific issues. 18) Consider professional data recovery services for valuable data on physically failing drives. 19) Be aware that opening drive enclosures may void warranties but can sometimes reveal whether the issue is with the enclosure controller rather than the drive itself."

    "question": "How do I fix a computer that's overheating?",
    "answer": "Overheating requires both immediate mitigation and addressing root causes to prevent potential hardware damage. First, verify the problem through temperature monitoring: 1) Install monitoring software like HWiNFO, Core Temp, or Open Hardware Monitor (Windows), Intel Power Gadget or TG Pro (Mac), or lm-sensors (Linux) to establish baseline temperatures under idle and load conditions. 2) Recognize concerning thresholds - most CPUs should stay under 80-85°C under full load, while GPUs typically operate safely up to 85-90°C. For immediate cooling: 3) Ensure proper ventilation by elevating laptops slightly for better airflow and positioning desktops with adequate clearance around intake/exhaust vents. 4) Close demanding applications and processes consuming high CPU/GPU resources. 5) Power down the system completely if temperatures reach critical levels (typically above 95°C for most components). Address dust accumulation, the most common cause of cooling degradation: 6) For desktops, open the case (after powering down and grounding yourself) and use compressed air to clean dust from heatsinks, fans, and vents, holding fan blades still while cleaning to prevent bearing damage from over-rotation. 7) For laptops, use compressed air at low pressure directed into ventilation ports at an angle that blows dust outward, not deeper into the system. Specialized cleaning tools like keyboard brushes can help with accessible vents. For cooling system optimization: 8) Verify all cooling fans are functional by visually inspecting during operation or temporarily blocking exhaust (briefly) to feel for airflow. 9) Check for correct fan operation in BIOS/UEFI settings or using fan control software. 10) Ensure proper case airflow with intake fans at front/bottom and exhaust fans at rear/top. For thermal interface improvement in desktops or advanced laptop maintenance: 11) Replace thermal paste if it's been more than 2-3 years since last application or if temperatures suddenly increased. This requires removing the CPU/GPU cooler, carefully cleaning old paste with isopropyl alcohol, and applying an appropriate amount of new high-quality thermal compound. For system-level solutions: 12) Update BIOS/firmware which may improve thermal management. 13) Adjust power settings to limit performance during non-demanding tasks - use balanced or power saver modes. 14) Undervolt CPU/GPU using tools like ThrottleStop or MSI Afterburner (requires research specific to your hardware model). If problems persist: 15) Consider hardware upgrades like additional case fans, more efficient CPU coolers, or repasting with higher quality thermal compound. 16) For laptops with persistent issues, cooling pads can provide marginal improvements, though internal cleaning and repasting typically offer more significant benefits."
