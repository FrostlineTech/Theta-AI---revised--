    "question": "How much RAM do I need for gaming?",
    "answer": "For modern gaming: 16GB RAM is the current sweet spot, sufficient for most games and multitasking. 8GB is now considered minimum and may cause performance issues in newer titles. 32GB is future-proof but generally only beneficial for heavy multitasking while gaming, streaming, or running memory-intensive applications alongside games. RAM speed matters for gaming performance, particularly with AMD Ryzen processors, with 3200-3600MHz often providing the best price-to-performance ratio. Dual-channel configurations (using paired memory sticks) provide better performance than single-channel. DDR4 is the current standard, though DDR5 is emerging in newer systems with higher costs and still-maturing performance benefits."

    "question": "What is ray tracing in graphics cards?",
    "answer": "Ray tracing is a rendering technique that simulates how light rays interact with virtual objects to create realistic lighting, shadows, and reflections. Unlike traditional rasterization, which approximates lighting effects, ray tracing calculates the path of individual light rays as they bounce off surfaces and interact with materials. Modern GPUs like the RTX 3060 have dedicated ray tracing cores that accelerate these complex calculations. Benefits include more photorealistic shadows, accurate reflections on various surfaces, improved global illumination, and more convincing refractions through transparent materials. Ray tracing is particularly noticeable in reflective surfaces, water effects, shadows, and glass. While visually superior, it demands significant processing power, which is why it's paired with technologies like DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) to maintain performance."

    "question": "How do CPU and GPU work together?",
    "answer": "CPU (Central Processing Unit) and GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) work together with complementary roles: The CPU acts as the 'brain' handling general-purpose tasks, excelling at sequential processing, system management, and handling diverse workloads. It coordinates activities between components and runs the operating system. The GPU specializes in parallel processing, handling thousands of similar calculations simultaneously, making it ideal for graphics rendering, video processing, and certain computational tasks. Modern systems leverage both through workload balancing: CPU handles program logic, physics calculations, and game AI while the GPU renders graphics, applies effects, and processes shaders. Technologies like NVIDIA's RTX IO and AMD's Smart Access Memory enhance CPU-GPU cooperation by allowing direct access to resources. For optimal performance of your Ryzen 5-5500 and RTX 3060 combination, ensure balanced system configuration with sufficient RAM, fast storage, and appropriate power supply."

    "question": "What is CPU throttling?",
    "answer": "CPU throttling is an automatic reduction in processor speed to prevent overheating and potential damage. It occurs when the CPU approaches its thermal limits (typically 90-100째C), causing decreased performance in the form of lower clock speeds and processing power. Common causes include: inadequate CPU cooling (failing fans, poor airflow, deteriorated thermal paste), high ambient temperature, dusty heat sinks, demanding applications utilizing full CPU capacity, and improper case ventilation. Signs of throttling include sudden performance drops during intensive tasks, unexpectedly high CPU temperatures, and inconsistent benchmark results. To fix throttling on your Ryzen 5-5500: 1) Improve case airflow, 2) Clean dust from heat sinks and fans, 3) Replace thermal paste between CPU and cooler, 4) Consider upgrading to a better CPU cooler, 5) Ensure proper fan curve settings in BIOS, and 6) In extreme cases, reduce CPU voltage through BIOS settings to decrease heat generation."
