    "question": "What is defense in depth?",
    "answer": "Defense in depth is a cybersecurity strategy that employs multiple layers of security controls throughout an IT system. Rather than relying on a single security measure, it uses various mechanisms at different layers to protect assets. If one security control fails, others still provide protection. Examples include firewalls, IDS/IPS, antivirus, access controls, encryption, and security awareness training."

    "question": "What is an API?",
    "answer": "API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of definitions, protocols, and tools for building software and applications. APIs allow different software components to communicate with each other according to a set of clearly defined methods. They abstract complex code and provide consistent functionality while allowing developers to use the implementation without knowing the underlying details. Common types include REST APIs, SOAP APIs, GraphQL, and WebSockets. APIs are essential for modern software development, enabling integration between different systems and services."

    "question": "What is 100x100?",
    "answer": "In computing, 100x100 can refer to a grid or matrix size of 100 rows by 100 columns, containing 10,000 elements total. It could also represent an image resolution of 100 pixels by 100 pixels. In certain programming contexts, it might refer to a benchmark aiming for 100 times improvement in performance or efficiency. Without more specific context, it's generally understood as a mathematical calculation equaling 10,000."

    "question": "How does machine learning work?",
    "answer": "Machine learning works by training algorithms on data to identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention. The process involves collecting data, preparing it (cleaning and normalizing), selecting an appropriate algorithm, training the model by feeding it data, evaluating performance using metrics like accuracy or error rates, tuning parameters to optimize results, and finally deploying the model for predictions on new data. Common approaches include supervised learning (training on labeled data), unsupervised learning (finding patterns in unlabeled data), and reinforcement learning (learning through trial and error with rewards). Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, uses neural networks with multiple layers to process complex patterns and has revolutionized fields like computer vision and natural language processing."

  {
    "question": "What is a neural network?",
    "answer": "A neural network is a computational model inspired by the human brain's structure and function. It consists of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers: an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each connection between neurons has a weight that adjusts during training. Neurons process inputs through activation functions to produce outputs. Neural networks learn by adjusting weights through backpropagation, minimizing the difference between predicted and actual outputs. They excel at pattern recognition, classification, regression, and handling complex non-linear relationships in data. Deep neural networks with many hidden layers (deep learning) have revolutionized artificial intelligence, powering advances in image recognition, natural language processing, and many other fields."

    "question": "What is Docker?",
    "answer": "Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using containerization technology. Containers package an application with all its dependencies, including code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings, into a standardized unit that can run consistently across different environments. Unlike virtual machines, containers share the host system's OS kernel, making them lightweight and fast to start. Docker's key components include Docker Engine (runtime), Dockerfile (script to build containers), Docker images (templates for containers), Docker Hub (repository for sharing images), and Docker Compose (tool for defining multi-container applications). Benefits include consistency across environments, isolation, resource efficiency, scalability, and faster deployment cycles. Docker has become fundamental to modern DevOps practices and cloud-native application development."

  {
    "question": "What is Kubernetes?",
    "answer": "Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications. Originally developed by Google and now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, Kubernetes addresses the challenges of running containers at scale. Key features include: automated deployment and rollback, service discovery and load balancing, horizontal scaling, self-healing (automatically replacing failed containers), secret and configuration management, storage orchestration, and batch execution. The architecture consists of a master node controlling worker nodes where containers run in pods, the smallest deployable units. Kubernetes abstracts away infrastructure complexity, enabling declarative configuration where users specify desired state and the system maintains it. While Docker provides the containerization technology, Kubernetes orchestrates these containers across multiple hosts, making it essential for large-scale production environments."

  {
    "question": "What is CI/CD?",
    "answer": "CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery or Deployment) is a software development approach that automates the process of integrating code changes and delivering applications to production environments. Continuous Integration involves automatically building and testing code changes whenever developers commit updates to a shared repository, detecting integration issues early. Continuous Delivery extends this by automatically preparing code changes for release to production, ensuring deployable code at any time. Continuous Deployment takes this further by automatically releasing validated changes to production without manual intervention. The pipeline typically includes stages for source code management, building, testing (unit, integration, performance), security scanning, artifact storage, and deployment. CI/CD practices reduce integration problems, improve software quality, accelerate delivery cycles, and provide faster feedback to development teams. Popular CI/CD tools include Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, CircleCI, and Azure DevOps."

  {
    "question": "What are microservices?",
    "answer": "Microservices architecture is an approach to software development where applications are built as a collection of small, independent services that communicate through well-defined APIs. Each microservice focuses on a specific business function, can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, and typically has its own database to ensure loose coupling. This contrasts with monolithic architecture where all functionality exists in a single codebase. Key characteristics include: independent deployability, technological diversity (different services can use different technologies), resilience (failure in one service doesn't bring down the entire system), scalability (individual services can scale based on demand), and organizational alignment (teams can own specific services). While microservices offer benefits like agility, resilience, and scalability, they also introduce challenges around distributed systems complexity, data consistency, testing, and operational overhead. Companies like Netflix, Amazon, and Uber have successfully implemented microservices to achieve greater development velocity and system reliability."

  {
    "question": "What is blockchain technology?",
    "answer": "Blockchain technology is a decentralized, distributed ledger system that records transactions across multiple computers. Each record (block) contains transaction data and is cryptographically linked to the previous block, forming a chain. Once added, blocks cannot be altered without changing all subsequent blocks and obtaining network consensus, making the system highly secure and tamper-resistant. Key features include: decentralization (no central authority), transparency (all participants can view the ledger), immutability (records cannot be changed), consensus mechanisms (like Proof of Work or Proof of Stake) to validate transactions, and smart contracts (self-executing agreements with terms written in code). While blockchain is the technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, its applications extend to supply chain management, digital identity verification, voting systems, healthcare records, and financial services. The technology continues to evolve with solutions addressing scalability, energy consumption, and regulatory compliance challenges."

    "question": "What is quantum computing?",
    "answer": "Quantum computing is a revolutionary computing paradigm that leverages principles of quantum mechanics to process information. Unlike classical computers that use bits (0s and 1s), quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits that can exist in multiple states simultaneously through superposition, dramatically increasing computational power for certain problems. Quantum entanglement, where qubits become interconnected and act as a system, further enhances processing capabilities. Quantum computers excel at solving specific problems like factoring large numbers, optimization, simulation of quantum systems, and certain types of searches that are intractable for classical computers. Current quantum computers are noisy and require error correction, with companies like IBM, Google, Microsoft, and various research institutions working to develop more stable systems. Potential applications include cryptography (both breaking existing systems and creating new ones), drug discovery, materials science, financial modeling, and artificial intelligence. While still in early stages, quantum computing has the potential to transform fields that require immense computational resources."
