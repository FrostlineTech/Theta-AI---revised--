    "question": "How does the internet work?",
    "answer": "The internet works as a global network of interconnected computer networks communicating via standardized protocols. At its foundation is the TCP/IP protocol suite - TCP breaks data into packets and ensures reliable delivery, while IP handles addressing and routing. When you access a website, your browser initiates a request that begins with a DNS lookup, converting the human-readable domain name to an IP address. This request travels through multiple network layers: from your device through your local network, to your ISP, through internet exchange points, and eventually to the destination server, often traversing dozens of routers along optimized paths. The server processes your request and sends back data packets that your browser reassembles into the webpage you see. Key infrastructure components include backbone networks (high-capacity data routes), internet exchange points (where networks interconnect), domain name servers, and data centers. The system is fundamentally decentralized, with no single controlling entity, relying instead on standards organizations like IETF and W3C to establish protocols that enable global interoperability. This architecture provides remarkable resilience - the network continues functioning even when parts of it fail."

  {
    "question": "What's the difference between AI and machine learning?",
    "answer": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are related but distinct concepts in a hierarchical relationship. AI is the broader field focused on creating systems that can perform tasks requiring human intelligence, including reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. It encompasses multiple approaches, including rule-based expert systems, evolutionary algorithms, and machine learning itself. Machine Learning is a subset of AI focused specifically on developing algorithms that improve automatically through experience. Instead of explicit programming, ML systems learn patterns from data to make predictions or decisions. Deep Learning further narrows the scope as a specialized subset of ML using neural networks with multiple layers (hence \"deep\") to progressively extract higher-level features from raw input. The key distinction is that while all machine learning is AI, not all AI approaches use machine learning. Traditional AI might use hard-coded rules and logic, while ML relies on statistical patterns in data. The recent AI revolution has been primarily driven by advances in machine learning, particularly deep learning, which has dramatically improved capabilities in areas like computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning."
